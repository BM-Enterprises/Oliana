# Hello-AI

This repo is a single rust binary which excersizes the library [`floneum`](https://github.com/floneum/floneum)
to perform important tasks that will eventually go into a more well-thought-out game.

# Compiling

To transform the source code into a `.exe` program, run

```
cargo build --release
```


# Running

After compoling, run `./target/release/hello-ai-game[.exe]`

You can directly compile & run in one step via `cargo run --release`
